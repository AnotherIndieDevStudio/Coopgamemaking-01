#What is this?
We here at Another Indie Dev Studio (AIDS for short) have decided to create a social experiment where we ask the community to make a game.

#More Explanation Please!
Here's the deal. If you head over to http://coopgamemaking.com, you will notice a very bland game (as of creation). There is nothing there but a leveling system and some useless information. We want the community to make this game into something that you would want to play. It can head in any direction the community feels it should go in. You can add graphics, some functionality or even just pitch some ideas for developers to work with. Again, it is completely up to you guys to create this game. You guys will vote on the top ideas and each week these will be added to the official game. Of course, if there is anything we feel needs to be added into, we will add it. 

#What Will This Game Run On?
The game will be made entirely with HTML, CSS, Javascript and MySQL (but we'll handle the server side stuff). 

#Who Can Participate?
This project is intended for everyone from the programming scrubs to the graphics designers to the neckbearded tryhards.

#Development Server
