<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this?</h1>

<p>If you have stumbled here by accident, then welcome. This subreddit is dedicated to making a game! How cool is that? This is a social experiment to see where the community takes game creation. Players can make it an extremely fun game or make it completely rubbish. </p>

<p>It's up to you guys to come up with the ideas and the code for the game. No we're not lazy. We just want to see where this is going.</p>

<p>The current game we are working on is simply a prototype and is just a testing grounds to see whether the community is will to participate. Whilst written in Javascript, we feel that allot of content can be added.</p>

<p>Later, if this proves to be successful, we can let the real fun begin and start working with proper game engines where the community can attempt to make a massive hit game.</p>

<a id="what-do-i-need-to-participate" class="anchor" href="#what-do-i-need-to-participate" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do I need to participate?</h1>

<p>Nothing really. The current game is using Javascript with Jquery. Javascript is really easy to pickup on and you can create some cool content with minimal work. The game could also use some graphics, if that is what the community feels it needs. You could work with the HTML and CSS to make it a bit more stylish if you feel the need to as well. </p>

<h1>
<a id="to-do-list" class="anchor" href="#to-do-list" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To do list</h1>

<p>This is what we will personally add to the game or plan on adding:</p>

<ul>
<li>A way to verify stats (have an idea just need to put it into practice).</li>
<li>A less resource hogging method of saving/loading.</li>
<li>We understand JavaScript variables can be changed and until we can verify stats, go crazy. The database will be wiped as soon as we are able to verify them.</li>
<li>Tidy up the code a bit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="submission" class="anchor" href="#submission" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Submission</h3>

<p>Submit your idea with a screenshot (if relevant), code uploaded to Pastebin or Github (fully commented and readable), resources (images, sounds) uploaded to a respectful file sharing service. Then add a description to the idea as well as a TLDR at the end. Use the flair "Submission".</p>

<h3>
<a id="removal-request" class="anchor" href="#removal-request" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Removal Request</h3>

<p>If you want something removed, link to the thread in which the content is. Leave a valid reason as to why it should be removed from the game. Use the flair "Removal Request".</p>

<h3>

<p>If you have an idea but aren't familiar with programming, use the flair "Idea" with a good description of what you want.</p>

<h3>
